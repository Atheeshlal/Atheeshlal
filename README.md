My name is Atheeshlal Pallath, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in the EEE Department, with a specialization in Power Engineering. I am proud to be ranked 2nd in the department, maintaining an overall CPI of 9.72.

I am deeply passionate about power electronics, particularly in the areas of hardware development and testing. My MTech project focuses on the design and development of a modular DC-DC converter for battery charging applications, a project that has allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge in this field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as the course coordinator for the EE101 course, which caters to more than 1,000 undergraduate students. I am the only course coordinator from the MTech program, a role that has enhanced my leadership and organizational skills.

I am also actively involved in the department as a placement representative, where I take on the responsibility of facilitating placement opportunities for my peers.

I am eager to further develop my skills in power electronics and am looking forward to opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects in this area. I am always open to connecting with professionals and peers in the industry to exchange ideas, discuss potential collaborations, and explore new opportunities.- 👋 Hi, I’m @Atheeshlal
